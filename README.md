# Markov-Chain-Analysis
This project runs through different methods to compute the steady state vector of a Markov process created using synthetic data and is known as a PageRank algorithm.

The analysis goes through a basic random walk as well as three methods for calculating the steady state vector:
1. Monte Carlo method
2. Matrix multiplication
3. Finding left eigenvectors

Libraries used:
scipy, numpy, networkx, random
